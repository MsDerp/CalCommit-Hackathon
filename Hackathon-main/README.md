## ✏️ Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a web application that provides personalized nutrition and exercise recommendations to users based on their health goals, dietary preferences, and physical activity level.With the pandemic coming to an end, many of us are going back into the world. This web application offers an enjoyable way for users to join the rest of their communities feeling the best/healthest they have ever felt.

Users would be able to input information about themselves, including their age, weight, height, gender, and any dietary restrictions or allergies. They would also be able to specify their health goals, such as weight loss, muscle building, or general wellness. With the help of spoonacular API, the application would use this information to create a customized meal plan and receipes. The application will also create a exercise routine for the user tailored to the user's fitness level and goals. Features such as progress tracking, a social component to connect with friends, and the ability to connect with a nutritionist or personal trainer make the health journey of each user fullfilling.
